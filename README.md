# Advent-of-Code-2021

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc]

In this repository I'm about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] or Swift language. 

Disclaimer - Not sure how many puzzles I'll have time to do this year ðŸ˜…


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
